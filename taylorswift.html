                <h4>Lyrics</h4>
                <p>We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January<br>
                    And this is our place, we make the rules<br>
                    And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear<br>
                    Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?<br>
                    Can I go where you go?<br>
                    Can we always be this close forever and ever?<br>
                    And ah, take me out, and take me home<br>
                    You're my, my, my, my<br>
                    Lover<br>
                    We could let our friends crash in the living room<br>
                    This is our place, we make the call<br>
                    And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you<br>
                    I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all<br>
                    Can I go where you go?<br>
                    Can we always be this close forever and ever?<br>
                    And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)<br>
                    You're my, my, my, my<br>
                    Lover<br>
                    Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?<br>
                    With every guitar string scar on my hand<br>
                    I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover<br>
                    My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue<br>
                    All's well that ends well to end up with you<br>
                    Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover<br>
                    And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me<br>
                    And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover<br>
                    Can I go where you go?<br>
                    Can we always be this close forever and ever?<br>
                    And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)<br>
                    You're my, my, my, my<br>
                    Oh, you're my, my, my, my<br>
                    Darling, you're my, my, my, my<br>
                    Lover.</p>
